                question: "What is TOGAF and when was it developed?",
                answer: "TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) is an industry-standard framework for enterprise architecture that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise IT architecture. It was developed starting in 1995 by The Open Group, based on DoD's TAFIM."
            },
            {
                question: "What are the four architecture levels that TOGAF typically models?",
                answer: "TOGAF typically models enterprise architecture at four levels:<ul><li><strong>Business Architecture</strong></li><li><strong>Application Architecture</strong></li><li><strong>Data Architecture</strong></li><li><strong>Technology Architecture</strong></li></ul>"
            },
            {
                question: "What is the relationship between TOGAF and SAP Enterprise Architecture Framework?",
                answer: "The SAP EA Framework builds upon TOGAF as its foundation. Since TOGAF is a generic framework that requires adaptation for specific contexts, SAP has tailored TOGAF to create a refined methodology that reduces tailoring efforts for typical architecture needs in SAP environments."
            },

                question: "What is the Architecture Development Method (ADM)?",
                answer: "The ADM is the core component of TOGAF that describes how to develop a specific enterprise architecture in the context of business requirements. It is a process template for developing architecture, organized in different phases, and is iterative over the whole process, between phases, and within phases."

                question: "What are the key characteristics of the ADM process?",
                answer: "The ADM is:<ul><li><strong>Iterative</strong> - over the whole process, between phases, and within phases</li><li><strong>Flexible</strong> - decisions must be made for each iteration regarding breadth, detail level, time period, and architectural assets to leverage</li><li><strong>Generic</strong> - intended for use by enterprises in various geographies and industry sectors</li></ul>"

                question: "What is the iterative nature of TOGAF ADM phases?",
                answer: "TOGAF ADM is iterative at multiple levels:<ul><li><strong>Whole process iteration</strong> - entire ADM cycle can be repeated</li><li><strong>Between phases iteration</strong> - can move back and forth between phases</li><li><strong>Within phases iteration</strong> - iterative work within individual phases</li><li>Each iteration allows for <strong>refinement and adjustment</strong> based on new insights</li></ul>"

                question: "What factors should guide ADM iteration decisions?",
                answer: "ADM iteration decisions should be based on:<ul><li><strong>Practical assessment</strong> of resource and competence availability</li><li><strong>Value assessment</strong> - what can realistically accrue to the enterprise</li><li><strong>Scope considerations</strong> - breadth and depth appropriate for the situation</li><li><strong>Available architectural assets</strong> - leveraging existing work and industry standards</li></ul>"

                question: "How does Phase A establish the foundation for the entire ADM cycle?",
                answer: "Phase A establishes the foundation by:<ul><li><strong>Defining the broader context</strong> in which all architecture work takes place</li><li><strong>Setting up the project</strong> and governance structure</li><li><strong>Assessing organizational capability</strong> to understand current state</li><li><strong>Creating the vision</strong> that guides all subsequent phases</li><li><strong>Establishing stakeholder engagement</strong> and communication</li></ul>"

                question: "How do Application and Data Architecture work together in Phase C?",
                answer: "Application and Data Architecture are interconnected in Phase C:<ul><li><strong>Applications</strong> provide services that support business processes</li><li><strong>Data</strong> flows through applications to enable business operations</li><li><strong>Interdependencies</strong> between applications are often data-driven</li><li><strong>Both architectures</strong> must align to enable the Target Business Architecture</li><li><strong>Integration patterns</strong> emerge from application-data relationships</li></ul>"

                question: "What is the strategic importance of the Architecture Roadmap in Phase E?",
                answer: "The Architecture Roadmap is strategically important because it:<ul><li><strong>Provides a 3-5 year transition plan</strong> to target architecture</li><li><strong>Balances final target achievement</strong> with incremental business value</li><li><strong>Identifies dependencies</strong> between programs and projects</li><li><strong>Aligns with stakeholder requirements</strong> and transformation readiness</li><li><strong>Enables incremental implementation</strong> while maintaining architectural coherence</li></ul>"
