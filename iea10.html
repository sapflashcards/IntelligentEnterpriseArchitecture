  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between \"as-is\" and \"to-be\" models in Enterprise Architecture?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How is \"architecture\" defined in the context of Enterprise Architecture?",
    "answer": "Architecture defines the abstract construction of a system - whether it's a building, an organization, an IT-system, a machine, and so on. [cite: 14]"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can an IT system have multiple architectures?",
    "answer": "No, an IT system has exactly one consistent architecture, which can be displayed in different views or levels of detail for different purposes and stakeholders. [cite: 16]"
  },
  {
    "question": "Why might different stakeholders need different viewpoints of the same architecture?",
    "answer": "Because business stakeholders might be interested in a process viewpoint, while IT stakeholders might want to understand solution components, their interactions, or physical deployment. [cite: 18]"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main purpose of Enterprise Architecture frameworks?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does an architecture framework structure architects' thinking?",
    "answer": "By dividing the architecture description into domains, layers, or views, and offering models (typically matrices and diagrams) for documenting each view. [cite: 24]"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are two important dimensions that Enterprise Architecture frameworks help address?",
    "answer": "Making systemic design decisions on all components of the system and making long-term decisions around new design requirements, sustainability, and support. [cite: 26]"
  },
  {
    "question": "What role does \"common language and vocabulary\" play in Enterprise Architecture?",
    "answer": "It's an important characteristic that helps define and introduce consistency across the organization when applying a holistic view that embraces both business and IT functions. [cite: 28]"
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Enterprise Architecture help avoid IT complexity?",
    "answer": "By supporting communication between different stakeholders from business and IT, and avoiding the creation of IT systems that add further complexity to existing IT infrastructure. [cite: 30]"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is at the center of all Enterprise Architecture viewpoints?",
    "answer": "One Enterprise Architecture - demonstrating that despite multiple viewpoints and diagrams, there is only one consistent architecture for the enterprise. [cite: 32]"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the four main viewpoints shown in the Enterprise Architecture multiple viewpoints model?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between static structural views and dynamic process-oriented views in Enterprise Architecture?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Which viewpoints are categorized as \"static, structural views\" versus \"dynamic, process-oriented views\"?",
    "answer": "Static structural views include Solution Components and Components Deployment. [cite: 38] Dynamic process-oriented views include Business Process and Solution Component Interaction. [cite: 39]"
  },
  {
    "question": "What types of diagrams are used to represent the different Enterprise Architecture viewpoints?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is TOGAF and when was it developed?",
    "answer": "TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) is an industry-standard framework for enterprise architecture that provides an approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise IT architecture. [cite: 42] It was developed starting in 1995 by The Open Group, based on DoD's TAFIM. [cite: 42]"
  },

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the relationship between TOGAF and SAP Enterprise Architecture Framework?",
    "answer": "The SAP EA Framework builds upon TOGAF as its foundation. [cite: 44] Since TOGAF is a generic framework that requires adaptation for specific contexts, SAP has tailored TOGAF to create a refined methodology that reduces tailoring efforts for typical architecture needs in SAP environments. [cite: 44]"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Architecture Development Method (ADM)?",
    "answer": "The ADM is the core component of TOGAF that describes how to develop a specific enterprise architecture in the context of business requirements. [cite: 45] It is a process template for developing architecture, organized in different phases, and is iterative over the whole process, between phases, and within phases. [cite: 45]"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key characteristics of the ADM process?",
    "answer": "The ADM is: Iterative - over the whole process, between phases, and within phases[cite: 46]; Flexible - decisions must be made for each iteration regarding breadth, detail level, time period, and architectural assets to leverage[cite: 46]; Generic - intended for use by enterprises in various geographies and industry sectors. [cite: 46]"
  },
  {
    "question": "What decisions must be made for each ADM iteration?",
    "answer": "For each ADM iteration, decisions must be made regarding: The breadth of coverage of the enterprise to be defined[cite: 47]; The level of detail to be defined[cite: 47]; The extent of the time period aimed at[cite: 47]; The architectural assets to be leveraged (previous iterations, industry assets, frameworks, models). [cite: 48]"
  },
